#  TASKTASK
## What are we doing?
The project TaskTask got created as part of the course *"Programming for data sciences"* at the university of Bern. This project aims to create a taskmanager with all the functionality you would expect. Categories, deadlines, taskfilters, task sorting, visualization of completed and ongoing tasks.\

Our goal is to provide an extensive and intuitive way to organise your daily Tasks. Through visualization of task statistic the user also gains valuable insights into his habits. It also provides an interesting feedback which can work as a basis for change or optimisation of your daily taskplanning.

## How are we doing it?
As we just started this project there is not much here. You can see the milestones in our roadmap. This is a python project and use the following Librarys:

1. [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) for GUI
2. [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for DataFrame/.csv storage
3. [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for data visualization

## What's our plan?
You can find our timeplan in the [roadmap](https://github.com/PythonDataScience24/Personal_Task_manager/blob/main/roadmap.md)!
## How can you help?
Because its a rather small and short project and we just started you can contact us via E-Mail if you want to help: briac.ledermann@students.unibe.ch

## SETUP
To set up this project, simply clone the repo into your local folder. 

Make sure that [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) are installed.

To run the program, you have to run the ui.py file in the 'src' folder. 

Since we are still in pre-alpha phase, there will already be some tasks stored for testing purposes.
