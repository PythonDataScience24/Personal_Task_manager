## Mission
```
Mission: Our mission is to make users more productive, and make sure that they reach their own
goals by easily keeping track of their tasks and not having to worry about organizing themselves
anymore. No more missed deadlines!
```
## Summary
```
This is a task manager/to-do list that helps users organize themselves and track their tasks
and deadlines. It supports functions such as adding, editing and removing tasks, adding details, such
as description, priority, due dates and status, and splitting the tasks into multiple subcategories, so
that it’s clearer. This tool also provides data visualization and productivity analysis, so that the user
can see their own performance and adjust accordingly.
